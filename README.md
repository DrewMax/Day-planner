# Day-planner

## Purpose
Day planner is an application that allows the user to create entries for various tasks that they need to complete throughout the typicall 9-5 work-day. To simplify recognizing which tasks have been done, which are due soon, and which need to be completed in the future, each block is color-coordinated according to the current time. Past tasks are colored grey, present tasks red, and future tasks green. 
Each task can be modified and re-saved after it has initially been entered, and each task persists in local storage once the page is refreshed. 
The current local time is also displayed at the top of the page for quick reference.
